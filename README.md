# Agent Manager

Run one background [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) agent per intent, and keep track of them from a web UI or the `agentmgr` CLI.

- **Intents in, agents out.** Give one intent or a list (one per line). Each becomes its own `claude` process.
- **Repo or folder.** Give a git URL (cloned once, then each agent gets its own worktree and branch) or a local folder.
- **Background terminals.** Agents run inside the daemon's PTYs. Open any agent's live terminal in the browser (**Open terminal**) or in your shell (`agentmgr attach`). Closing the view leaves the agent running.
- **Session IDs are kept.** Each agent is started with a known `--session-id`. **Close session** stops the process but keeps the ID, and bringing it back runs `claude --resume <id>`. **New session** adds another ID to the agent's history; earlier ones stay resumable.
- **Tracking.** For each agent you see its session ID, working folder, repo, branch, head commit, uncommitted changes, cost, PRs and bugs.

## Install

```sh
npm install
npm link            # optional: puts `agentmgr` on your PATH
```

Requires Node 20+, `git`, and the `claude` CLI. `gh` (authenticated) is optional; it enables PR discovery by branch and PR state.

## Use

```sh
agentmgr ui                                   # start the daemon and open http://127.0.0.1:4717

agentmgr add "Fix the flaky login test" -d ~/src/app
agentmgr add -r https://github.com/org/repo.git \
  "Add pagination to /users" "Investigate MB-12345 and open a fix PR"
agentmgr add -f intents.txt -r git@github.com:org/repo.git -p acceptEdits

agentmgr ls                                   # status, branch, PR/bug counts, session
agentmgr show <agent>                         # everything tracked for one agent
agentmgr attach <agent>                       # live terminal here; Ctrl-] detaches (resumes a closed agent)
agentmgr stop <agent> | --all                 # close the session, keep its ID
agentmgr start <agent> [--fresh | -s <session>]
agentmgr sessions <agent>                     # every session ID this agent has used
agentmgr link <agent> --pr <url> --bug MB-123
agentmgr rm <agent> [--delete-workspace]
agentmgr shutdown
```

`<agent>` can be the ID, a unique ID prefix, or the name. Every command starts the daemon if it isn't already running.

### Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `preparing` | Cloning or creating the worktree |
| `working` | Claude is producing output |
| `waiting` | Claude is idle, waiting for its next instruction |
| `needs input` | A trust or permission prompt is blocking the agent. Open its terminal to answer. |
| `stopped` | Closed by you or by a daemon restart. Resumable. |
| `exited` | Claude exited on its own (for example `/exit`). Resumable. |
| `error` | Workspace setup or launch failed. See the error message. |

The first launch in a new folder shows Claude's "trust this folder" prompt, so new agents usually start in `needs input`.

## Where things come from

| Field | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Session ID | Assigned by agentmgr (`--session-id`). If Claude switches sessions mid-run (`/clear`), the new transcript in the agent's folder is adopted. |
| Folder / repo / branch | The workspace agentmgr prepared, plus `git` in that folder |
| PRs | `pr-link` records in the session transcript (PRs Claude created), `gh pr list --head <branch>`, PR URLs mentioned in the conversation, and links you add |
| Bugs | Refs in the intent, Jira `/browse/KEY-1` and GitHub issue URLs in the conversation, custom `bugPatterns`, and links you add |
| Title / cost | `ai-title` and `cost-state` records in the transcript |

Removing a detected link dismisses it, so it doesn't come back on the next scan.

## Configuration

State lives in `~/.agentmanager/` (`state.json`, `daemon.log`, `repos/` for shared clones, `workspaces/` for worktrees). Set `AGENTMGR_HOME` or `AGENTMGR_PORT` to change the location or port. Optional `~/.agentmanager/config.json`:

```json
{
  "claudeArgs": ["--model", "opus"],
  "permissionMode": "acceptEdits",
  "bugPatterns": ["\\bMB-\\d+\\b"],
  "gitRefreshSec": 15,
  "prRefreshSec": 120
}
```

## Security

The daemon drives real terminals, so it is locked down to this machine:

- It listens on `127.0.0.1` only.
- It rejects requests whose `Host` is not loopback, which blocks DNS rebinding.
- It rejects browser requests from any other origin, which blocks cross-site WebSockets.
- Every write needs an `x-agentmgr` header, which browsers can't send cross-origin.

Anyone with a shell on the machine as your user can still use it.

## Notes

- Agents live in the daemon process. Restarting the daemon (or `agentmgr shutdown`) closes them, and their sessions are saved. They show as `stopped` and resume with the same session ID.
- Child `claude` processes get a clean environment. The markers a parent Claude Code session sets (such as `CLAUDE_CODE_CHILD_SESSION`) are removed, because inherited markers switch transcript saving off and then the session can't be resumed.
- `rm --delete-workspace` only deletes worktrees and folders agentmgr created, never a folder you passed with `-d`.

## Development

```sh
npm test    # unit tests + end-to-end daemon tests against a stub claude (test/fake-claude.js)
```
